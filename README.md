Learning rust by denoising BVOL from weakly volume influence

Assuming I will need a Kalman filter for initial diagnostic (finally!)

# Todo:
Introduce gaps in places of all holidays and skip the days of switching to and off the summer time

Account for the said summer time while it is ongoing

Transform this crap into a 3n tensor, with [years, weeks, days]
// to keep in mind - the fucking days are hillariosly unstable, and will have different sub-influence patterns during weekends
### apparently, polars solves this. The problem is now trivial; I'll come back to this after defining functionality of my lib is up
